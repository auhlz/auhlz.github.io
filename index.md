### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

One of my favorite labs was Lab 7, part 2 because I learned how functions worked by coding a simple blackjack game. I learned that functions return a parameter that is useable in the main code. I like functions because it helps with redundancy within the code and makes the main function more readable. 

* Lab 9

Lab 9 part 2 was a lab I also enjoyed as it was a simple spell checker. I use spell check in my daily life and coding a version of spell check was very fascinating and was another example of practicality within my code. Although it was simple I love practical applications when coding. This code would read a file of predetermined dictionary words and compare it to a given file. If all the words in the given file were found in the dictionary it would assume that all words were spelled correctly.

* Lab 10

Another Lab that I liked was lab 10 part 2 which was about counties. This was one of the first times I used a vector of vectors and the lab showed me how our code can be practical. This lab returned data about a given country from a predetermined vector. The code would loop through the index of the vector until it found what it was looking for and would then return the value. I loved how I was able to create code that was able to return valuable data when prompted.
